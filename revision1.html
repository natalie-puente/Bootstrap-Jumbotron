                <h2><u>My Hobbies</u></h2>
                <p><b>Shopping</b> - During my free time, I like to go shopping and spend money that I don't have! At
                    stores, I like to shop for new shoes and T-shirts. My favorite clothing stores include: Ross,
                    Target, and the mall. However, my favorite stores to shop for shoes are the Converse store and the
                    New Balance store. I especially love to shop, when I have friends with me, but whenever they come
                    with me, I usually end up spending more than I should have. Shopping and clothes are my biggest
                    weakness!</p>
                <p><b>Community Service</b> - I also like to participate in community service. I love to travel around town helping others,
                    whenever they need me. Usually, one will see me helping out at our local WRAP organization. I can
                    also be found at our local park, helping kids learn the game of soccer. On Tuesday evenings and
                    Saturday mornings, I am always at the park teaching kids the rules and techniques correlating to
                    soccer.</p>

                <h2><u>My Favorite Sports</u></h2>
                <p><b>Sports</b> - Since I was little, my favorite sport was soccer. I used to play all the time and on
                    many different teams. On T.V., I like to watch the U.S. National Women's team play soccer. They are
                    one of my favorite teams in the national soccer league. One time, I even got to see the team play in
                    Nashville at Nissan Stadium. That was the best experience I have ever had! </p>
                <p>While I do like to play soccer, I also love to watch football. During the months of September through
                    early February, I like to watch NFL football, especially on Sundays. One thing not many people know
                    about is that my favorite football team is the New England Patriots, but I like to watch all the
                    teams.</p>
